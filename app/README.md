# Spendit App

User-end application of Spendit.

## Project Setup

Since platform-specific code can be automatically generated by Capacitor, they are not included in the repository. To set up Android or iOS support, refer to [Capacitor Docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/).

To configure the server API for production, you need to add `VITE_SPENDIT_API` in `.dev.production` file. For example:

```
VITE_SPENDIT_API=https://your.domain/api
```
